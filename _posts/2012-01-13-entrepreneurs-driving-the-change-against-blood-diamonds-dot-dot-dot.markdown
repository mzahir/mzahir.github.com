Tonight at our [Technori](http://www.technori.com) get together, I had the pleasure of meeting [Narimon
Safavi](http://www.niacouncil.org/site/PageServer?pagename=About_safavi),
who was in the jewelry business for several years until he dived into
diamond mining in West Africa. He had come across the opportunity to
mine and worked around the insurgencies/warlords to differentiate his
product. It marked the begininning of the movement against blood
diamonds.

He is currently working on an incubator for cultural startups, as in
startups that are around cultural/exotic paintings, teaching dances,
etc. Very cool idea but kind of hard to follow up on the blood diamond
bit :)
