Since [our generation does not sleep](http://i.imgur.com/DTAlZ.png),
except for those [lucky elites](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703712504576242701752957910.html),
the deprivation leaves us exhausted. 

Not wanting to sacrifice the sacred early hours of trolling our favorite
forums (or of watching cat videos), we have been cornered into figuring out a
way to get the most from the few hours we sleep.

Apparently, you can time yourself to wake up at the top of a sleep cycle, which leaves you feeling
(relatively) refreshed. You go through multiple cycles a night so there
are a whole bunch of time slots you can go to bed at.

The catch is that the calculation will require you to count backwards
from the time you want to wake up, counting which sleep cycle you want
to get up at. Even though it is a simple calculation, it can tempt you
to keep counting backwards for the rest of the night and not get any
sleep at all.

Luckily for us, [(Sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) is a simple website
that gives you the time slots you should be gunning for. These are the
times that should be falling asleep so make sure to add in some buffer
time for your bedtime rituals. Whatever they may be.

Thank you but it's quite alright. There is no need to share your ritual.

Personally, I haven't felt much of a difference but I don't end up
falling asleep at the required time either. Perhaps there needs to be a variation of the website that plays mind games with you and tells you the wrong time to fall asleep by, knowing that you'll end up sleeping at the correct time. ConspiringSleepyti.me! 

Sleep Tight!
