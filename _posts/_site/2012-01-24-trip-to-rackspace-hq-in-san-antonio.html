<p>Last week I had the pleasure of visiting the headquarters of <a href='http://www.rackspace.com'>Rackspace</a>, an <a href='http://openstack.org'>innovative and leading</a> cloud hosting provider to discuss some of their newer product offerings and iron out implementation details for a large client of <a href='http://www.acquitygroup.com'>Acquity Group</a>. The agenda included a tour of their facilities by an early employee who goes by <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/95329814@N00/741359538'>Sugar Bear</a>. There&#8217;s a great story as to how he got his name but we&#8217;re already straying off-course&#8230;</p>

<p>Based out of Texas, the company welcomes the Cowboy persona to the workplace. I don&#8217;t mean Cowboy in the sense that there is little to no preparation with everyone shooting from the hip. By keeping the organization very flat, a large pool of decision makers are hands-on and aren&#8217;t afraid to dwelve into the technical details.</p>

<p>The company also prides itself in providing the best customer service, a trait not too far from the state&#8217;s <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hospitality'>Southern Hospitality</a></p>

<p>The work area also has flags hanging from above the range from various national flags to sports teams. The company also awards tenured Rackers with milestone flags (&#8216;X Year Racker&#8217;). Having everybody (including the CEO) sit in an open area cube, there is a very egalitarian atmosphere and Executive Management seemed very open and easy to approach.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Rackspace, their main headquarters used to be <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervyns'>Mervyn&#8217;s Department Store</a>. One of the employees had rented out his prom tux from a store that is currently a conference room.</p>

<p><img alt='Rackspace 1302' src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2blavl2u4awrtxz/7BCySHimko/rackspace/IMG_1302.JPG' /></p>

<p>After Mervyn&#8217;s closed its doors, Rackspace purchased the property, split it into segments and began construction. Precaution was taken to minimize waste and donate any materials over to the community.</p>

<p>Nicknamed &#8220;The Castle&#8221; by Rackers, their relocation to the HQ was tagged &#8220;Storm the Castle&#8221;. There are entertaining videos of the CEO, Lanham Napier, giving a pep rallies to his employees to get ready for the battle.</p>

<p>But what&#8217;s the point of a castle without breaking any world records, right?</p>

<p><img alt='Rackspace 1295' src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2blavl2u4awrtxz/iLYp6Feb5e/rackspace/IMG_1295.JPG' /> <img alt='Rackspace 1297' src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2blavl2u4awrtxz/nmf46TxUWF/rackspace/IMG_1297.JPG' /> <img alt='Rackspace 1298' src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2blavl2u4awrtxz/mlwIeuyyVj/rackspace/IMG_1298.JPG' /></p>

<h2 id='environmentally_friendly'>Environmentally Friendly</h2>

<p>The Castle is <a href='http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988'>LEED Gold Certified</a>. If that doesn&#8217;t mean much to you, think energy efficient lights everywhere, greener building materials and toilets that have two settings to flush.</p>

<p>They also have a wicked cool fan - the &#8220;Big Ass Fan&#8221; <img alt='Rackspace 1311' src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2blavl2u4awrtxz/Jc4kc9kXJ3/rackspace/IMG_1311.JPG' /> <img alt='Rackspace 1312' src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2blavl2u4awrtxz/68Iade4LD9/rackspace/IMG_1312.JPG' /></p>

<p>Because cool tech companies realize their employees miss their younger days. As in way younger days.</p>

<p>One of the newer areas of the castle has a dedicated area for a museum. How about that? :)</p>

<h2 id='awesome_tshirts'>Awesome T-Shirts</h2>

<p>A lot of employees were wearing different Rackspace t-shirts and there was a nice display of the past t-shirt campaigns by the HR area. Their internal marketing team seems to have gotten the memo about avoiding terrible bland t-shirts.</p>

<h2 id='summing_it_up'>Summing it up</h2>

<p>The day I visited, the Company was hosting a celebration in their outdoor area (which looked like it used to be the loading dock for the mall) for ranking #74 on the &#8216;Forbes Best companes to work for&#8217; list. There was a whiteboard congratulating the Rackers and somebody had scrawled on &#8220;We&#8217;re #1, no matter what&#8221;.</p>

<p>Their enthusiasm was contagious :)</p>
