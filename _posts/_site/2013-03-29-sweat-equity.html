<p>The phrase &#8216;Sweat Equity&#8217; gets thrown around a lot, especially within the tech startup community. According to the <a href='http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sweat%20equity'>Merriam Webster</a> dictionary, the origin of the phrase goes all the way back to the (then) new found American dream of homeownership.</p>

<p>As more homeowners went the DIY route to enhance and in turn, add more value to their houses on their own toil, they earned <strong>sweat equity</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sweat Equity : An interest or increased value in a property earned from labor toward upkeep or restoration. The term is used to describe the value added to real estate by owners who make improvements by their own toil <a href='https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CJABEJoTKAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSweat_equity&amp;ei=7V5VUfGeDJHPqQGeu4GgBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNErIqlTfDiD8nQmAXj_rgrT4h7OHw&amp;sig2=K6lulclSoS2DcoDQzyWRkQ&amp;bvm=bv.44442042,d.aWM'>-Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Despite its frequent use within tech circles, the phrase seems to lack. The <em>sweat</em> doesn&#8217;t seem to add much value to <em>equity</em>. Why? Let&#8217;s look at how a modifier before <em>equity</em> could assist in specificity (among other things).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You&#8217;re <em>sweating</em> away because you&#8217;ve been given stocks in exchange for services that you have agreed to fulfill</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A vested equity plan has got you <em>sweating</em> - You need to keep working for X years before you&#8217;ll have actual ownership of all the stocks you were promised</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You have direct influence on the stock value and you&#8217;re <em>sweating</em> away to increase their long-term shareholder value (Ugh, it feels dirty to sound like a Wall Street banker)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You&#8217;re receiving only equity and no pay</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You&#8217;re receiving below-market / depressed wages and equity</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on, so the next time you&#8217;re chatting about equity over a no-whip skinny vanilla latte, be smart: Leave it at &#8220;equity&#8221; or use modifiers that add value (such as &#8220;vested&#8221; or &#8220;contingent&#8221;) or are more specific (&#8220;stock options&#8221;, &#8220;warrants&#8221;, &#8220;convertible notes&#8221;)</p>
