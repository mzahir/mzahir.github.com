<p>After letting my blog idle for an year, I figured it was time to get back to some writing. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), <a href='http://octopress.org/'>Octopress</a> had a few too many updates for me to apply them painlessly.</p>

<p>I ended up going through a bit of a manual update process. However, Heroku was rather unimpressed with the updated Sinatra application. This wasn&#8217;t the first time this week that I&#8217;ve run into issues deploying apps to Heroku. If only there was another easy to use, hacker friendly Ruby PaaS. Enter, <a href='http://www.cloudfoundry.com/'>Cloud Foundry</a>. (<a href='https://www.engineyard.com/'>EngineYard</a>? Sure, they are worthy of a mention too but they were third on my list and I never got that far down the list).</p>

<p>Even though the <a href='http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/tools/vmc/vmc-quick-ref.html'>vmc</a> command doesn&#8217;t show as much information as <a href='https://toolbelt.heroku.com/'>heroku&#8217;s toolbelt</a>, the interactive wizard-like prompts make it easier for newcomers to adapt. The CF apps also don&#8217;t get passivated as frequently as Heroku&#8217;s (if ever?).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to (hopefully) more writing! :)</p>
