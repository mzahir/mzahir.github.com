<p>It has been a couple of years since I first dove into Ruby on Rails to build some side projects. However, there&#8217;s still an awful lot of magic going on with the framework.</p>

<p>With the release of Rails 4, there seems to be even more magic to make everything easier. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve found myself in a tough spot whenever the magic ceases to work for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Look in to the source? Sure, but unless you&#8217;re very strong with your ruby, all the elegant, clever code isn&#8217;t exactly an easy read.</p>

<p>Turns out the creator of <a href='http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/'>Thin</a>, <a href='http://macournoyer.com/'>Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer</a> has a class called <a href='http://owningrails.com/'>Owning Rails</a> that has you building &#8220;a mini version of rails from scratch&#8221;.</p>

<p>A pretty good deal for a little over $500, considering that you also get a copy of his book <a href='http://createyourproglang.com/'>Create Your Own Programming Language</a> (The starting point for CoffeeScript).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the class seems to be limited and full, with a waiting list. I liked the idea of building a mini version of rails - luckily, someone else has a similar take on mastering rails.</p>

<p><a href='http://rebuilding-rails.com/'>Rebuilding Rails</a> covers a similar challenge of building your own simpler framework on Rack to understand the internals of Rails. I went ahead and bought the book after going through the free first two chapters.</p>

<p><em>Gulp!</em> Here&#8217;s to less magic!</p>
