<p>Tonight at our <a href='http://www.technori.com'>Technori</a> get together, I had the pleasure of meeting <a href='http://www.niacouncil.org/site/PageServer?pagename=About_safavi'>Narimon Safavi</a>, who was in the jewelry business for several years until he dived into diamond mining in West Africa. He had come across the opportunity to mine and worked around the insurgencies/warlords to differentiate his product. It marked the begininning of the movement against blood diamonds.</p>

<p>He is currently working on an incubator for cultural startups, as in startups that are around cultural/exotic paintings, teaching dances, etc. Very cool idea but kind of hard to follow up on the blood diamond bit :)</p>
