<p>Since <a href='http://i.imgur.com/DTAlZ.png'>our generation does not sleep</a>, except for those <a href='http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703712504576242701752957910.html'>lucky elites</a>, the deprivation leaves us exhausted.</p>

<p>Not wanting to sacrifice the sacred early hours of trolling our favorite forums (or of watching cat videos), we have been cornered into figuring out a way to get the most from the few hours we sleep.</p>

<p>Apparently, you can time yourself to wake up at the top of a sleep cycle, which leaves you feeling (relatively) refreshed. You go through multiple cycles a night so there are a whole bunch of time slots you can go to bed at.</p>

<p>The catch is that the calculation will require you to count backwards from the time you want to wake up, counting which sleep cycle you want to get up at. Even though it is a simple calculation, it can tempt you to keep counting backwards for the rest of the night and not get any sleep at all.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, <a href='http://sleepyti.me/'>(Sleepyti.me</a> is a simple website that gives you the time slots you should be gunning for. These are the times that should be falling asleep so make sure to add in some buffer time for your bedtime rituals. Whatever they may be.</p>

<p>Thank you but it&#8217;s quite alright. There is no need to share your ritual.</p>

<p>Personally, I haven&#8217;t felt much of a difference but I don&#8217;t end up falling asleep at the required time either. Perhaps there needs to be a variation of the website that plays mind games with you and tells you the wrong time to fall asleep by, knowing that you&#8217;ll end up sleeping at the correct time.

<p>Sleep Tight!</p>
