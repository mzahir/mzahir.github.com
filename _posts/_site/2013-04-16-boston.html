<p>What happened at the Boston Marathon was awful. Painful. Heinous. Unjust.</p>

<p>I get that terror plots are inevitably all of the above (and more) but knowing people who have run the Boston Marathon and being a runner myself, this has been particularly hard to digest.</p>

<p>Boston is where the last leg of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheidippides'>Pheidippides&#8217;s</a> journey from Marathon to Athens has been celebrated since 1897. There is just so much work that goes into qualifying, to facing those hills tirelessly and of course, the pride of running alongside the best long distance runners of our time.</p>

<p>The endless cheers and encouragement from the sidelines&#8217; sea of support gives second wind to those on the verge of giving up. That&#8217;s what the race is about. A celebration of perseverance.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know the families who lost their loved ones or had them injured. But for those who live past today, I hope this doesn&#8217;t stop you from cheering. I hope this doesn&#8217;t stop you from running.</p>
