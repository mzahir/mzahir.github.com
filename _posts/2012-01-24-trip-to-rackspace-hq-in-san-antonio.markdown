Last week I had the pleasure of visiting the headquarters of [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com), an [innovative and leading](http://openstack.org) cloud hosting provider   to discuss some of their newer product offerings and iron out implementation details for a large client of [Acquity Group](http://www.acquitygroup.com). The agenda included a tour of their facilities by an early employee who goes by [Sugar Bear](http://www.flickr.com/photos/95329814@N00/741359538). There's a great story as to how he got his name but we're already straying off-course...

Culture
-------

![Rackspace 1300](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2blavl2u4awrtxz/RjSzrvhijn/rackspace/IMG_1300.JPG)

Based out of Texas, the company welcomes the Cowboy persona to the
workplace. I don't mean Cowboy in the sense that there is little to no
preparation with everyone shooting from the hip. By keeping the
organization very flat, a large pool of decision makers are hands-on and
aren't afraid to dwelve into the technical details.

The company also prides itself in providing the best customer service, a
trait not too far from the state's [Southern Hospitality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hospitality)

The work area also has flags hanging from above the range from various
national flags to sports teams. The company also awards tenured Rackers with
milestone flags ('X Year Racker'). Having everybody (including the CEO)
sit in an open area cube, there is a very egalitarian atmosphere and
Executive Management seemed very open and easy to approach.


The Castle
----------------------

If you're not familiar with Rackspace, their main headquarters used to
be [Mervyn's Department Store](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervyns).
One of the employees had rented out his prom tux from a store that is
currently a conference room.

After Mervyn's closed its doors, Rackspace purchased the property, split
it into segments and began construction. Precaution was taken to
minimize waste and donate any materials over to the
community.

Nicknamed "The Castle" by Rackers, their relocation to the HQ was tagged
"Storm the Castle". There are entertaining videos of the CEO, Lanham
Napier, giving a pep rallies to his employees to get ready for the
battle.

But what's the point of a castle without breaking any world records,
right?

Environmentally Friendly
------------------------

The Castle is [LEED Gold Certified](http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988). If
that doesn't mean much to you, think energy efficient lights everywhere,
greener building materials and toilets that have two settings to flush.

They also have a wicked cool fan - the "Big Ass Fan"

Obligatory Slide
----------------

Because cool tech companies realize their employees miss their younger
days. As in way younger days.

Preserving the history
----------------------

One of the newer areas of the castle has a dedicated area for a museum.
How about that? :)

Awesome T-Shirts
----------------

A lot of employees were wearing different Rackspace t-shirts and there
was a nice display of the past t-shirt campaigns by the HR area. Their
internal marketing team seems to have gotten the memo about avoiding
terrible bland t-shirts.

Summing it up
-------------

The day I visited, the Company was hosting a celebration in their
outdoor area (which looked like it used to be the loading dock for the
mall) for ranking #74 on the 'Forbes Best companes to work for' list.
There was a whiteboard congratulating the Rackers and somebody had
scrawled on "We're #1, no matter what".

Their enthusiasm was contagious :)
